Python OOP Concepts

# Classes
* A class in Python is a blueprint for creating objects.
* Object: An instance of a class.
* Attributes: Properties or variables belonging to an object that define its characteristics.
* Methods: Functions defined within a class that describe behaviors of an object.
* self: Refers to the specific instance of the class.
* __init__: A special method in Python known as the constructor, used to initialize attributes of an object when it's created.



# Encapsulation
Encapsulation
* Public attributes and methods
  * Public atrribute and public method can de accessed and modified from outside the class
  * By default, all attributes and methods in python are public

* Protected attributes and methods
  * protected attributes and methods are class members that should not be accessed directly from outside the class
  * However, they can be accessed within the class and in child classes (see below for more on child classes
  * Protected attributes are denoted by prefixing the attribute/method name with a single underscore
