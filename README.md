* A class is a blueprint for creating objects. 
* Object is an instance of a class
* Attributes are properties that define or belong to an object

* `__init__` is a special methid in python known as constructor

# Encapsulation
Encapsulation
* Public attributes and Public methods
  * Public atrribute and public method can de accessed and modified from outside the class
  * By default, all attributes and methods in python are public

* Protected attributes and methods
  * protected attributes and methods are class members that should not be accessed directly from outside the class
  * However, they can be accessed within the class and in child classes (see below for more on child classes
  * Protected attributes are denoted by prefixing the attribute/method name with a single underscore
